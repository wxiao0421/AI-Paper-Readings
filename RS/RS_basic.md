|[Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf)|Arxiv 2016|Combined generalized 
linear model (wide part) and deep learning (deep part) in a joint training framework. The wide part accomplishes the model's 
memorization and the deep part accomplishes the model's generalization. The wide part complements the weakness of the deep
part by adding with a small number of cross-product features.|60%|
|[Using Kinect for real-time emotion recognition via facial expressions](http://www.jzus.zju.edu.cn/opentxt.php?doi=10.1631/FITEE.1400209)|FIETT 2015| 1. A real-time emotion recognition approach based on both 2D and 3D facial expression features captured by Kinect sensors. 2. To capture the deformation of 3D mesh during facial expression, the features of animation units and feature point positions are combined. 3. A fusion algorithm based on improved emotional profiles (IEPs) and maximum confidence is proposed to recognize emotions. 4. Show superior performance of our method.|0%|
