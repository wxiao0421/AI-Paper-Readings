|[Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07792.pdf)|Arxiv 2016|Combined generalized linear model (wide part) and deep learning (deep part) in a joint training framework. The wide part accomplishes the model's memorization and the deep part accomplishes the model's generalization. The wide part complements the weakness of the deep part by adding with a small number of cross-product features.|60%|
